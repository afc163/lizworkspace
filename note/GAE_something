############################################################[google-appengine] Auto increment
Do you really need this? Remember, an autoincrement means every new
table row has to hit this one field - a situation which won't scale
well.
Consider these alternatives:
* Use the automatically-assigned key for the object (probably the
easiest method)
* Use a random string
* Use some timestamp-derived key (timestamp, then random hash to
prevent collisions)
If you really, really, truly, absolutely need autoincrement, you could
do it by creating some special model for sequence numbers, then
increment it and return the new value in a transaction. However I
again stress that this is almost certainly not what you really want,
and won't scale well.
/////////////
Every entity has a unique key, in your templates you can use {{ entity.key }}:

<a href="/path?key={{entity.key}}">link</a>

in the request handler you can get the entitiy with:

def get(self):
   key = self.request.get('key')
   entity = db.get(db.Key(key)) #or entity = ModelName.get(db.Key(key))
